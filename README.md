Minimal Java library with no external dependencies shared by many other projects.

## Project Links
* [Project Home](https://oss.aoapps.com/lang/)
* [Changelog](https://oss.aoapps.com/lang/changelog)
* [API Docs](https://oss.aoapps.com/lang/apidocs/)
* [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.aoapps/ao-lang)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ao-apps/ao-lang)

## Features
* Small, simple, unfocused utilities that are generally extensions to the standard Java libraries.
* Shared by many other projects and can be used to glue them together.
* Small footprint, self-contained, no transitive dependencies - not part of a big monolithic package.
* Java 1.8 implementation:
    * Android compatible.

## Motivation
As we untangle our monolitic [AO Hodgepodge](https://github.com/ao-apps/ao-hodgepodge) project, we are placing small, simple, and unfocused utilities into this new project.  These tools are generally extensions to the standard Java libraries.  The `ao-lang` project is used by many other projects, but does not have any dependencies itself.

## Alternatives
There may be functionality that is also found in other projects.  This project is of a different evolutionary origin.
* [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) - A popular set of extra methods generally extending the standard Java libraries.
* [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) - Google Core Libraries for Java.
